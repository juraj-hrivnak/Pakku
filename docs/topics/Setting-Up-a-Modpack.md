# Setting Up a Modpack

To set up a modpack, you can:

- Start form scratch and [create a new modpack](#creating-a-new-modpack).
- [Import an existing modpack](#importing-an-existing-modpack).
- [Migrate existing modpack from one platform to another or import modpack as multiplatform modpack](#migrating-modpack-s-platform-or-importing-as-multiplatform-modpack).

## Creating a New Modpack

To create a new modpack, run the [`pakku init`](pakku-init.md) command:

<include from="pakku-init.md" element-id="snippet-cmd"></include>

This will ask you to enter:

1. The name of the modpack.
2. The Minecraft versions supported by the modpack.
3. The mod loaders and their versions supported by the modpack.
4. The targeted platform of the modpack.

I will also set the version of the modpack to `0.0.1` and add `config` folder to the overrides.

If you made a mistake, you can change the properties of the modpack
using the [`pakku set`](pakku-set.md) command.

## Importing an Existing Modpack

To import an existing modpack, run the [`pakku import`](pakku-import.md) command with the `<path>` argument:

<include from="pakku-import.md" element-id="snippet-cmd"></include>

The `<path>` argument will only accept:
- CurseForge's modpack with the `.zip` extension or the CurseForge's `manifest.json` file.
- Modrinth's modpack with the `.mrpack` extension or the Modrinth's `modrinth.index.json` file.

Pakku automatically sets the targeted platform of your modpack based on the file you import.

> [Overrides](Pakku-Terminology.md#override) have to be copied over manually.

## Migrating Modpack's Platform or Importing as Multiplatform Modpack


You can import a CurseForge modpack as a Modrinth modpack or vice versa by doing the following:

<procedure>
<step>

[Create a new modpack](#creating-a-new-modpack) using the [`pakku init`](pakku-init.md) command.

</step>

<step>

Set the target to the platform you want to import your modpack to.

</step>

<step>

[Import the modpack](#importing-an-existing-modpack) using the [`pakku import`](pakku-import.md) command.

</step>
</procedure>

[//]: # (--)

You can import an existing CurseForge or Modrinth modpack as a multiplatform modpack by doing the following:

<procedure>
<step>

[Create a new modpack](#creating-a-new-modpack) using the [`pakku init`](pakku-init.md) command.

</step>

<step>

Set the target to the `multiplatform` target.

</step>

<step>

[Import the modpack](#importing-an-existing-modpack) using the [`pakku import`](pakku-import.md) command.

</step>
</procedure>

## Configuring CurseForge Access

Pakku requires users to provide their own CurseForge API key when accessing CurseForge.

According to [CurseForge for Studios REST API documentation](https://docs.curseforge.com/rest-api/#authentication), 
the API key can be generated in the [CurseForge for Studios developer console](https://console.curseforge.com/).

Follow these steps to configure the access:

1. Login to the [developer console](https://console.curseforge.com/#/login).
2. Go to the "API keys" tab: ![dev_console.png](dev_console.png)
3. Copy your API key.
4. Enter your API key to the prompt provided by Pakku,
or use the [`pakku credentials set`](pakku-credentials-set.md) command:
   
   <var name="params">--cf-api-key *********************</var>
   <include from="pakku-credentials-set.md" element-id="snippet-cmd"></include>

   > The API keys contain the dollar symbol (`$`) which needs to be escaped in the Bash shell.
   > You can also put the API key in double quotes.
